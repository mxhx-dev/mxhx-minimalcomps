# MXHX for MinimalComps

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.2
- MinimalComps from Github (0.9.2 from Haxelib is not compatible with modern OpenFL)

## Installation

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it from Github.

```sh
haxelib git mxhx-minimalcomps https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-minimalcomps.git
```

## Project Configuration

After installing the library above, add it to your OpenFL _project.xml_ file:

```xml
<haxelib name="mxhx-minimalcomps" />
```
